## Project Layout

The **cmd** directory will contain the application-specific code for the executable applications in the project. 

The **pkg** directory will contain the ancillary non-application-specific code used for the project. We'll use it to hold potentially reusable code like validation helpers and the database models for the project. 

The **root** folder will be for non-Go assets like go.mod, dockerfiles, git files, etc.
